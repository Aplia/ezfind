==============================
Autosuggest feature in eZ Find
==============================


Implementation with facets
==========================

Rationale
---------
One of the advantages of using facets are the caching mechanisms in Solr and the
natural ranking of terms according to their "popularity", ie occurences in the overall index

Query to be used
----------------

The following query and facet related (GET) query parameters are to be used:

q=*:*
facet=true  (enable facets)
facet.field=ezf_sp_word (the field to look for suggestions, the spell check field is the most suited)
facet.prefix=$input (the chracters typed so far by he user)
facet.limit=$limit (number of suggestions to return)




Concerns
========

- security can become an issue, maybe add the security filter from ezsolr class
