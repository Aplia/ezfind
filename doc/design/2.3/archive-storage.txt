Archive storage: part 1. Storing attribute content in Solr
=============================================================

Introduction
============

As part of the archive master user story, which ultimately
will provide alternate storge of content that might even be removed
from the eZ Publish database, this spec deals with storage of
attribute content in Solr

Solution overview
=================

A new configuration option is introduced:

[IndexOptions]
# Configure attribute storage in the Solr backend
# Warning: this may inflate the index size on large installations
# EnableSolrAttributeStorage=true | false
EnableSolrAttributeStorage=false

If this is set to true, attribute content will be serialized into a JSON master structure

For Solr, the backend schema field to use is "binary", which accepts base64 encoded arbitrary content

So for storage, the entire JSON string is encoded accordingly and sent along the other index fields
